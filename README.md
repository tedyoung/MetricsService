MetricsService
==========

*MetricsService is a prototype for providing a monitoring GUI for services built using [Dropwizard] (http://dropwizard.codahale.com).*

I tried using [Graphite] (http://graphite.wikidot.com) initially but its a hassle to set it up if you're in a standalone corporate intranet. Hence, I figured a lightweight HTML/JavaScript backed by Dropwizard would do the trick.
